*******************************DAY 7******************************

Workout: Cardio

1.Burpee
  77 seconds

2.Running, Treadmill
  7 minutes

During this workout, you'll test your two 
energy systems: aerobic and anaerobic systems.

Burpees: Do as many full burpees as you can in 77 seconds.
This means the crouch, drop, push-up, a hop onto your feet
and the final leap in one fluid movement. No cheating or half-assing it.
Then, write down your results.

Running: Run as far as you can in 7 minutes, but pace yourself
and be smart. You want to go as far as you can without tripping
and falling off the treadmill. Then, write down your results.
